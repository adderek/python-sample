	This STATIC html page is hosted on github.io<br/>
	You could host your own HTML page with CSS and JavaScript that runs in a web browser.<br/>
	You could also put images or movies here (although it is not wise).<br/>
	You cannot run applications on the server (no php, perl, python or similar).<br/>
	The github.io is meant to host your pages related to the github project - like README.md<br/>
	The github.io is NOT meant to store your personal page - and there are limits on how much it can be used
