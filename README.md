# python-sample
Example python code

Just a showcase to see what we can do with python.
If you intend to use it on production please be aware that it is
using AGPL 3 license thus **you must disclose the source code**.

# How to start if you know nothing
Install git (unless you already have one)

Execute `git clone git@github.com:adderek/python-sample.git`

Look at the `src/` directory and look at the examples

# Word about default branch
<details><summary>Click to view/hide</summary>
I have renamed default branch name back to master from main.

Github and many more companies are trying to follow the great confusion over the internet about USA slavery thing.
But I do not live in USA.

I live in Poland where slavery is usually about "white" people being slaves to other "white" people.
We had nothing like USA. We are not using feet, inches nor ounces.

I believe that all live matters, not only "black".
I must also say that I have never sen a black person, nor a white person.
As a physicist I can tell I have seen many people with different amount of pigment in their skin
but none of them had color white or black.

# Directory structure
I have decided to use following directories here:
- /src to store application sources
- /src to store unit tests
- /it to store integration tests
- /e2e to store end to end tests

# TODO's:
- Tests - if you write no unit tests then you cannot call yourself a developer
- Static analysis tools
- Build scripts - I'll try to prepare some king of continuous integration
- Microservices example
- Communication with correlation id
